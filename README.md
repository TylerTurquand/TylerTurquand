**Hi there! I'm Tyler** A professional Data Analyst

**Background**: A meticulous Data Analyst with a foundation in customer service and account management, eager to delve into the realms of data analytics. Proficient in data visualization and analysis tools like Tableau, Power BI, SQL, and Excel. Experienced in delivering actionable insights to drive informed business decisions. Open to engaging in outsourcing projects that require expertise in data visualization, analysis, and project management.

In my current role as Tenant & Parking Coordinator/Office Assistant at King Harbor Marina, I oversee account setup and closure processes for new tenants and guest slips. I manage monthly collections, take payments, and handle all frontline customer service responsibilities, including phone calls, walk-ins, and emails. Additionally, I conduct tours of apartments and offices, assist tenants with understanding their bills, create work orders on their behalf, and address any concerns they may have. 

While working full time, I decided to take on an intensive 4-month Business Intelligence Analytics course with TripleTen. This is where I picked up many technical skills required for data analysis and manipulation.

**Fun Facts**: Outside of data, I enjoy immersing myself in music, or creating music, and exploring nature through hikes and outdoor adventures.
